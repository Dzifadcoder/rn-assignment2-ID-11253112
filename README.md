In this assignment, i was given the task of creating a react Native app with Expo Cli.
In the App.js file in the expo project, i made a few modifications to the orginal code to personalize it. The tasks were to;
- Change the background color of the View component.
- Edit the Text component to display "My name is YourName".
- Increase the font size of the text to 24.
- Make the name "YourName" bold (over here, since my name is Dzifa i am supposed to make the Dzifa appear bold in the app).
